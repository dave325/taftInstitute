# Taft Institute

The Taft Institute for Government, a strictly nonpartisan, not-for-profit 501 c 3 organization, was founded in 1961 to expand and improve political participation in the United States. Our job is to create a redesign of the web site using wordpress. 

### Getting Started

We need to use a very specific IP Adress when creating the wordpress sites locally.
We should have MAMP/WAMP open up properly. 
When installing wordpress for each site, you want to set the config information to the remote database.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

MAMP/WAMP
Give me the IP Address to add to the Remote DB access host. Please limit the use of public IP because it allows anyone to use it.
